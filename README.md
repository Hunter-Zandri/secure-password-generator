Password Generator
The title of this project is "Password Generator" which I coded using javascript which ive been learning the past couple weeks.

Languages

Objective:

Make it so when the generate password button is clicked a password a series of prompts appears

When prompts appear, user is able to select which criteria they want including numnbers, special character, and upper/lowercase letters

When prompted for password length the user can only select a password betwen 8 and 128 characters

When user answers each prompt the answer is validates otherwise it re asks the question

When all prompts are answered then a password is generated for the user on the page
