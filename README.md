Password Generator
This projects title is Password Generator and it is a website that I coded the javascript for using my new found javascript coding skills so that it follows acceptance criteria.

Languages
Used javascript to code the backend of this website.

Objective
Make it so when the generate password button is clicked a password a series of prompts appears

When prompts appear, user is able to select which criteria they want including numnbers, special character, and upper/lowercase letters

When prompted for password length the user can only select a password betwen 8 and 128 characters

When user answers each prompt the answer is validates otherwise it re asks the question

When all prompts are answered then a password is generated for the user on the page

What was learned
I learned a lot more about how to use eventlisteners as well as various loops in javascript such as do while loops and switch case.
